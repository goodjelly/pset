# 20.440Finding_Urine_Metabolomic_Cues Between_Different_Blue_Crab_Diets_Using_Mass_Spectrometry_Data

Repo for the 440 final project report

Overview

this repo contains data sets from MS data of crab urine (Poulin et al. https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1713901115).

Bluecrab_Project_PythonCode.py organizes the data file into dataframes that simplifies our analysis process.
It generates bar plots that shows the top 10 chemicals with the higest peak from th negative and Positive mode of the MS data. 
All packages are conventional pandas, matplotlib or numpy packages as listed. 

Data

this data is reported by Poulin et al., after they organized the MS data from 6 crabs (MC and OB are ommited in the MS). 
This data set includes the chemical name (if identified), structure, m/z, retention time and peakhight etc fo reach of the crabs.
It can also be found here: (https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/DRCCMetadata.php?Mode=Study&StudyID=ST000922)

Folder structure

All code are in Code folder, in future there might be folders as: .ignore (#contains files users won't firectly use)
.figures(of generated figures), etc.
IT is recommended to run the code file X_Y_pset4.py in Colab since it is generated there. Use default Python 3 environment. 
Need to install pandas, numpy, matplotlit.


Figure

This is what the figure looks like after run code on Colab and Metaboanalyst5.0.
All figures in the Final Report are included here at original resolution.
